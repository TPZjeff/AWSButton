# AWSButton
a single button that logs to the TPZ server

This is designed to run on a Raspberry Zero. The single button is on pin 2 and connected to ground
The bashrc file has been modified on the Rpi image to start the python code at boot. This grabs and holds the terminal, which is regretable.
to set this up, use  "Method 2: .bashrc" from this website: https://www.dexterindustries.com/howto/run-a-program-on-your-raspberry-pi-at-startup/
